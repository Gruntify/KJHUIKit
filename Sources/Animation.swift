/** Protocol for objects that will do animations on behalf of a target.
 
 General guidelines for Animators:
 
 - They should be retained by something else, rather than retain themselves (ie within animation blocks etc).
 - They should not strongly retain the target.
 - Controllers wishing to interrupt animations should cancel() the animator then stopAnimations() on the target.
 - Views can encapsulate animators inside them for convenience and retention, and are encouraged to call cancel() on their animators when stopAnimations() is called.
 - Animators should not call stopAnimations() on the target during cancel(), so as to avoid infinite loops when encapsulated within views. That's why it's called cancel - just prevent further animations that may not have been set yet. In many cases an animator may have nothing to do in response to cancel().
 - Animators should contain actual animations (which may or may not be controlled by parameters) rather than just 'helper' logic. You should be able to simply apply an animator and see it working with default behaviours.
